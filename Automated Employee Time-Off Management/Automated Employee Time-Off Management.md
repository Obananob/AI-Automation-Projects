# Automated Employee Time-Off Management

## Overview
This Airtable-based system automates the process of handling employee leave requests. When an employee submits a request, the manager is notified via Gmail, and the manager’s decision is logged back into Airtable. The employee then receives a notification about whether the leave is approved or rejected.

## Tools Used
- **Airtable**: Stores employee data, leave requests, and approval statuses.
- **Gmail**: Sends notifications to managers and employees.

## How It Works
1. **Request Submission**: An employee fills out a time-off request form, which is recorded in Airtable.
2. **Manager Notification via Gmail**: An Airtable Automation sends an email to the manager with the request details.
3. **Manager Approval in Airtable**: The manager updates the request status directly in Airtable to “Approved” or “Rejected.”
4. **Employee Notification**: Airtable Automation sends an email to the employee to inform them of the decision.
5. **Record Keeping**: All requests and their statuses are logged for future reference.

## Time Savings
Automating this process saves significant time for HR and management, reducing the need for manual emails and follow-ups.
