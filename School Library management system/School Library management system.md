# School Library Management System

## Overview
The School Library Management System is an Airtable-based automation designed to streamline the process of managing library books, student checkouts, and returns. It automates notifications and tracks transactions to ensure efficient library operations.

## Tools Used
- **Airtable**: Used as the database to manage books, students, librarians, and transactions.
- **Automation Scripts**: Configured within Airtable to send notifications and manage workflows.

## How It Works
1. **Library Database**: All books, students, and transactions are stored in Airtable tables.
2. **Borrow Notification**: When a student borrows a book, the system sends a notification to the librarian.
3. **Return Tracking**: When a book is returned, the system updates the transaction record and sends a confirmation notification.
4. **Student Records**: Each student has a record that logs their borrowing history and any outstanding books.

## Time Savings
This system reduces the manual effort needed to track book loans and returns, saving librarians hours of administrative work each week.

## Required Authentications
- **Airtable API**: Needed to interact with the Airtable base for reading and writing records.

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced reporting features to analyze book circulation and student reading habits.
- Add integration with other school systems for seamless data sharing.
